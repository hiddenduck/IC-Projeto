# Solving satisfiability problems using Grover's Algorithm

This is the final project for a Quantum Computing course, where we aim to solve a Boolean satisfiability problem using Grover's Algorithm. The project involves designing a solvable 3-SAT Boolean formula, implementing Grover's Algorithm for solving the satisfiability problem, and assessing the quality of the solution employed by the quantum algorithm.
Problem Description

The Boolean formula we are using for this project is a 3-SAT problem with five clauses, where each clause has three literals. The goal is to find an assignment for each literal such that the function evaluates TRUE. This problem can be seen as a search problem, where the solution is the assignment where the Boolean formula is satisfied.

# Running the Code

To run the code, you need to have Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using pip:

pip install qiskit
